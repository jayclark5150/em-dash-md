# Em Dash

A markdown editor that lives entirely in your browser and stores every document in **Google Drive** — no other storage backend, no server, no database. Em Dash opens and saves files straight from Google's native Drive picker, gives you a live preview, and a distraction-free focus mode, all as an installable offline-capable PWA.

Google Workspace integrations push it further toward a personal knowledge management tool (like Notion or Obsidian, but Google-native) — Tasks keeps your to-dos, Calendar keeps your schedule, and Em Dash is where you actually write about all of it, with everything staying in your own Drive.

The closest thing to what Em Dash could become is a private Notion that lives entirely in your Google account — which is actually a pretty compelling niche Google has never filled themselves.

## Features

- **Google Drive as the only backend** — Em Dash reads and writes directly to your Drive. No separate app folder — it's just your Drive.
- **Google Picker for file navigation** — click the document icon in the header (or Ctrl+O) to open Google's native Drive file picker. Browse folders, search, and select any file. A clock icon gives quick access to your 8 most recently opened files.
- **Live preview** — markdown rendered as you type, with syntax-highlighted code blocks and one-click copy on fenced code. Editor and preview scroll in sync.
- **Focus mode** — open the `…` menu and choose **Focus Mode** to edit directly in the rendered view. Bold, italic, headings, and lists all work inline. Typewriter scrolling keeps the cursor centered. On exit it converts back to clean markdown automatically.
- **Find & replace** — with match navigation and replace-all.
- **Auto-save** — saves two seconds after you stop typing, straight to the open Drive file.
- **Import / Export** — Import uploads a local `.md`/`.txt` file from disk into your Drive root. Export downloads as `.md`, `.txt`, `.html`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.rtf`.
- **Offline** — installable as a PWA; the app shell works without a connection (Drive sync obviously needs one).
- **Three themes** — Lokai (warm parchment palette), Dark (warm-dark), and Light (clean white). Persisted across sessions.
- **Open in Drive** — a small ↗ icon in the status bar links directly to the current file in drive.google.com.
- **Export as PDF** — "Export as PDF" in the `…` menu renders the current document to a print-ready popup and opens the browser's print dialog. Choose "Save as PDF" to download.
- Line numbers, word/character count, adjustable zoom, and light keyboard shortcuts.

## Tech

Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no build step, no framework. It uses [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) for parsing, [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to sanitize rendered HTML, [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code highlighting, and [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) for HTML→Markdown in focus mode. Drive access uses Google's `gapi` client and Google Identity Services (GSI) for OAuth. All third-party scripts are version-pinned with Subresource Integrity, and the app ships a Content Security Policy.

## Setup

Because storage is Google Drive only, Em Dash needs a working Google OAuth client to do anything useful.

### 1. Create Google Cloud credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Create (or select) a project, then enable the **Google Drive API** (APIs & Services → Library).
3. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Application type: *Web application*). Add the origin(s) you'll serve the app from (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`, your production URL) under **Authorized JavaScript origins**.
4. Create an **API key** (APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → API key). Restrict it: **HTTP referrers** limited to your domain(s), and **API restrictions** limited to the Google Drive API.
5. Note the OAuth scope the app requests: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`. This is full read/write access to the account's Drive. This was chosen deliberately over the narrower `drive.file` scope: `drive.file` only grants access to files an app creates or that a user individually selects via Google's file picker, which does not scale to a Drive with dozens or hundreds of existing files (each one would need to be selected one at a time). If you're publishing the OAuth consent screen beyond "Testing" status for broader use, Google requires a verification review for this scope — see [Drive API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) for the tradeoffs of narrower alternatives.
6. **If you're upgrading from an older version of Em Dash** that used the `drive.file` scope, existing users need to reconnect (Sign out of Drive, then Connect Google Drive again) so the browser re-prompts for the new, broader permission — a previously-issued token won't automatically pick up the wider scope.

### 2. Configure the app

```bash
cp config.example.js config.js   # then add your Google credentials
npx serve .                       # serve locally (PWAs need https or localhost)
```

Edit `config.js` and fill in:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — the OAuth Client ID from step 1.
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — the API key from step 1.

Open the local URL in Chrome or Edge, click **Connect Google Drive** from the "…" menu, and grant access.

`config.js` is **gitignored** and never committed. Because the app is fully client-side, any API key it uses is visible in the browser — that's why it's restricted by HTTP referrer and scoped to the Drive API only in step 1.

## Deployment

The repo is configured for **Vercel**. `vercel.json` sets `build-config.js` as the build command, which reads `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from Vercel's Environment Variables and writes them into `config.js` at deploy time. `config.js` is gitignored, so credentials never touch the repo.

To deploy your own copy:

1. Import the repo into [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. Add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` under Project Settings → Environment Variables (no `DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_NAME` needed).
3. Push to `main` — Vercel builds and deploys automatically.

Remember to add your Vercel deployment URL to the API key's HTTP referrer restrictions and to your OAuth client's authorized JavaScript origins in the Google Cloud Console.

## Changelog

### v3.13.0

- **Google Picker replaces sidebar** — the custom Drive file tree sidebar has been removed and replaced with Google's native file Picker (the same browser-window-style picker you see elsewhere in Google's products). Click the document icon in the header (or Ctrl+O) to open it. A clock icon next to it gives quick access to your 8 most recently opened files. The database view and board view have been removed in this version.

### v3.12.0

- **Synchronized scroll in split view** — scrolling the editor now scrolls the preview pane proportionally, and vice versa. Both panes stay in sync automatically without any UI toggle needed.

### v3.11.0

- **Warm Claude-style palette** — replaces the dark Lokai toolbar and GitHub-blue accents across all three themes. Lokai (default) now uses a warm parchment base (`#faf9f5` background, `#f0eee6`/`#e8e4d9` surfaces, `#e3ddd0` borders, terracotta `#d97757`/`#c15f3c` accents). Dark is retinted to a warm-dark palette (`#1a1714` base). Light is now a clean all-white palette (`#ffffff`). All hardcoded blue values (`#58a6ff`, `#0969da`, `rgba(88,166,255,*)`) replaced with terracotta equivalents.
- **Larger font sizes** — editor and line numbers: 14 px → 16 px; file tree: 14 px → 14.5 px; modal, database table, and board-card text each increase by 1 px.
- **PWA theme color** — `manifest.json` `theme_color`/`background_color` and the HTML `meta[name=theme-color]` updated to `#faf9f5`.

### v3.10.0

- **Board view** — hover any folder in the sidebar and click the new columns icon to open it as a Kanban board. Each subfolder becomes a column; each file becomes a draggable card. Drag a card between columns to move the file in Drive. Click any card to open the file in the editor. "+ Add task" creates a new `.md` file directly in that column's Drive folder. Escape or the Back button returns to the editor.

### v3.9.0

- **My Drive root** — Em Dash now shows your full Drive tree starting at My Drive root instead of keeping files inside a dedicated "Em Dash" subfolder. The sidebar header reads "My Drive" and all files/folders in your Drive are directly accessible. Existing files in the old Em Dash subfolder remain exactly where they are — they just appear as a regular folder in the tree.

### v3.8.0

- **Resizable sidebar** — drag the handle at the right edge of the file tree to set the sidebar width anywhere from 150 px to 500 px. The chosen width persists through sidebar open/close toggles.
- **Folder state preserved on refresh** — previously, any action that triggered a tree refresh (save, move, rename, delete, new file) would collapse all expanded folders back to their closed state. Expanded folders now stay open and repopulate their contents automatically after every refresh.

### v3.7.0

- **Tags column in database view** — Tags is now a permanent system column (between Title and auto-detected frontmatter columns). Click any cell to edit tags as a comma-separated list; they persist as a YAML array in each file's frontmatter. Empty cells show an "Add tags…" placeholder. Sortable by tag content.
- **Export as PDF** — "Export as PDF" in the `…` menu renders the current markdown to a styled print popup and auto-triggers the browser's print dialog. Print-optimized CSS handles page breaks, pre-wrap for code blocks, table borders, and clean typography. Syntax highlighting reuses the already-cached highlight.js stylesheet.

### v3.6.0

- **Sidebar toggle** — Cmd+\ (or the panel button in the header) hides/shows the sidebar, giving you a full-width editor when you need it.
- **Duplicate file** — hover a file in the sidebar and click the copy icon to create "Copy of …" in the same folder.
- **Add frontmatter property from database view** — click "+ Add property" in the database toolbar (or the ghost column header at the right end of the table) to define a new column by name; it appears immediately for all rows.
- **Database view caching** — reopening a database folder you already visited no longer re-fetches all file contents; the row data is held in memory and reused until the sidebar is refreshed.
- **New Row collision fix** — clicking "+ New Row" twice in the same day now produces `YYYY-MM-DD-untitled.md` and `YYYY-MM-DD-untitled-2.md` instead of two files with the same name.

### v3.5.0

- **Database view** — hover any subfolder and click the table icon to open it as a spreadsheet. `.md` files become rows, YAML frontmatter keys become columns. Text cells edit inline, booleans render as checkboxes, arrays as tag chips. Modified date and file size are always present as system columns. Sortable by any column header. "+ New Row" creates a blank `.md` file in the folder.
- **Recently opened files** — collapsible "Recent" section at the top of the sidebar, last 8 files, persisted in localStorage. Click the header chevron to collapse or expand.
- **Open in Drive link** — ↗ icon in the status bar opens the current file directly in drive.google.com.
- **Folder item count** — expanded folders show a muted count badge next to the folder name.
- **Z→A default sort** — sidebar tree and database view both default to descending name order so ISO-date filenames show newest first.
- **UI font size 14px** — increased from 13px across all UI elements.
- **Fixed find bar focus** — the search box no longer lost focus after the first keystroke.

### v3.2.0

- **Sidebar sort-direction toggle** — a button in the sidebar header switches between A→Z and Z→A name order; since filenames use ISO date prefixes this also serves as a date sort.
- **README: clarified Focus Mode** — the feature bullet now explains that Focus Mode is how you type and edit directly in the rendered view, rather than in markdown source.

### v3.1.0

- **Switched OAuth scope from `drive.file` to full `drive`** — the narrow scope required individually granting access to every pre-existing file via Google's picker, which doesn't hold up for folders with real file counts (hundreds of files). The app now sees everything in the "Em Dash" folder immediately after connecting; existing users need to reconnect once to pick up the wider permission. Removed the interim "Sync Existing Drive Files…" picker flow this replaces.
- **Fixed folder listing pagination** — the sidebar tree previously capped at 200 items per folder with no pagination, silently dropping anything past that; it now pages through the full folder contents.

### v3.0.0 — Em Dash

Em Dash is a rebrand and reboot of the previous "Markdown PWA" project, focused entirely around Google Drive as a real, navigable filing system:

- **Persistent sidebar with a real Drive folder tree** — replaces the old flat "Open from Drive" file-picker modal. Folders and files are fetched lazily via the Drive API v3 as you expand them.
- **Drag-and-drop reparenting** — drag any file or folder onto another folder to move it.
- **Inline create / rename / delete** — new files and folders are created inline in the tree (no modal); rename via double-click or the pencil icon; delete via the trash icon, with confirmation.
- **Import / Export** — Import uploads a local file into the selected Drive folder; Export downloads the open file back to disk.
- **OneDrive removed** — Microsoft Graph / MSAL.js sign-in, and all OneDrive UI, have been removed. Google Drive is now the only storage backend.
- **Local disk editing removed** — the File System Access API open/save/save-as/rename flow is gone. Import and Export cover the "get a file in or out" need without the complexity of two parallel storage models.
- **Simplified header menu** — the "…" menu now only has Import, Export, Connect/Sign out of Drive, and Focus Mode.

### v2.1.4
- Copy button fixes (found in code review): rapid double-clicking no longer strands the button on the checkmark icon; a failed clipboard fallback (`execCommand`) now correctly shows "Copy failed"; raw `<pre>` blocks with no fenced code no longer get a non-functional copy button.

### v2.1.3
- Copy button on code blocks — every fenced code block in the preview pane got a copy icon.

### v2.1.0 – v2.1.2
- Unified file menu across Disk/Drive/OneDrive; Drive/OneDrive menu-state parity.

### v2.0.0
- OneDrive sync via Microsoft Graph (MSAL.js, SPA + PKCE).

### v1.5.0 – v1.5.1
- UI redesign (header bar + format bar), three themes, WYSIWYG focus mode, iPad/iPhone PWA support.
